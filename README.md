The compiler reads network services specified as Queuing Petri Nets (QPNs) and automatically generates corresponding simulation code. This supports the precise specification of the network services and their accurate analysis.

*Input*: Network services specified as QPNs using TimeNet 4.4 (in XML format)

*Output*: Simulation code for OMNeT++ 5.2, ready for import and execution
